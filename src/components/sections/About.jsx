      <p className="text-slate-400 max-w-5xl">
        I'm Yunus, a data–driven professional with a unique mix of experience in
        recruitment, fitness, finance, and analytics. Over the last few years I’ve
        worked as a trainee recruiter, fitness trainer, and financial/data handler,
        which taught me how to understand people, manage data responsibly, and think
        in terms of real business outcomes.
      </p>

      <p className="text-slate-400 max-w-5xl">
        Recently I’ve been focusing on business intelligence and data analytics,
        building interactive dashboards in Power BI for healthcare and fitness
        organizations. I enjoy turning raw numbers into clear visuals and insights
        that help teams make better decisions. Alongside this, I’m learning React,
        JavaScript, and Python to expand my ability to build end-to-end solutions.
      </p>

      <p className="text-slate-400 max-w-5xl">
        I’m looking for opportunities where I can grow as a data / BI professional,
        contribute to meaningful projects, and work with teams that value curiosity,
        ownership, and continuous learning.
